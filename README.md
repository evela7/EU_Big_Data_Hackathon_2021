# EU_Big_Data_Hackathon_2021


The European Big Data Hackathon 2021 organised by the European Commission (Eurostat).

Twenty-one teams from European National Statistical Institutes and Universities competed to develop a data analytics tool to address this year's challenge: "How to simulate and forecast international trade relations in a network at high product and time resolutions?"

Statistics Poland created an open source prototype delivering a dashboard for Forecasting and Simulating Trading Trends.


The Dashboard is a web application in Open Source model, with API included. The data shown was calculated with Big Data tools and methods. It includes descriptive statistics, neural networks, machine learning, prediction, visualization, etc.
Currently there are ore than 25 charts like KPI on the dashboard. In total there are more than 200 graphs available based on the Big Data sources. User can search through more than 30 indicators with interactive tables and charts.


## Built With
1) Data processing: Hadoop, Apache Spark, noSQL (MongDB)
2) Data analysing: R, Python
3) Data dissemination: Ruby, Jekyll, Github (https, api)
